# Pac Man
A pac man game made using processing

# How to run the game
This game runs in processing, so if you don't have that application you can download it here: https://processing.org/
If you do have processing, cool!

To run this game through processing you must first download the file.
Once that is done, put that file in a folder titled the same as the file name (the folder should be called Pac_Man_Game).
Next, open the file in the processing app and click the run button on the top left of the screen.
After you click on the run button then another window should pop up containing the playable game.

Note: If the controls do not work then click on the game window to focus the mouse.
